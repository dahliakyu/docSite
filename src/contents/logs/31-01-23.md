## What have I done in the past few days

v1.01 of this website is now full running!!

Didn't write up anything because I was stuck with a bug of preact hook struggle to reading types for a few days and turns out to be that I did not install @astro/preact dependency.

This one is going to the lessons learnt again: **please please please check up the package.json properly before you steal from another template\***.

Now the documentation has a fully functioning left and right sidebar showing the sections (separate .md files) and the headings respectively. The sidebar components are stolen from the full version of the official [astro documentation site](https://github.com/withastro/docs), but I wish to personalise it further in the future.

Slowly writing up the documentations and will keep on working on the updates website and the neuro database this week!!

## Other Stuff

### Over the weekend

Watched ice age and monster.inc again. Ice age was great but somehow felt like the scene setting is not as good as Shrek but monster.inc is still truly a masterpiece.

Also went to bouldering at a desolate place to the south of lelylaan with a cut on my index finger, was fun but was really limited by the wound. Also there were people trampolining on the top and gave me quite a bit of anxiety looking at them. Now most of my upper body muscle is very stiff because of it. Went to my local Ethiopian restaurant after bouldering, as the runner complimented my newly shaved head, I commented him that he seemed to grow a bit of beard and he was very happy about that as he struggled to grow any facial hair for a while:

said him

"evey time aunt sees me she'd say

'wow you have nothing growing on your face let me give you a kiss on the cheek'"

and he gets very upset about it.

Anyway, best Ethiopian in the city, I feel conflicted recommending it to people because they are so full all the time already. But here it is: [Fenan Klein Afrika](https://www.fenankleinafrika-amsterdam.nl/).

## What I still need to do for this website

- somehow the emoji and custom html tags are not working anymore with the .md files anymore, had a quick check up apparently it is a font issue, need to find solution
- showing images in .md
- figure out cross .md references
- slim down the rightsidebar and related components
- style is still a big big mess, a few things to be done:
  - toggle buttons for the side bars in mobile version (@media)
  - ambitious plan to unify everything into tailwind
  - if you managed the previous then adapt the current obsidian style you are using

## Final Remark

I am writing this right now listening to yosuke yukimastu (or ¥ØU$UK€ ¥UK1MAT$U if you really want to)'s [keep hush set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K65xwSXlUw) and the sophie tracks really caught me off guard |ω；｀).
