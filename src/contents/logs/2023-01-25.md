### Work Logs

#### from about 11am to 3.30pm

Spent a few hours trying to figure out how to automate pulishing my notes up on gitbook. Unfortunately coming to the conclusion that the editor of Gitbook is not the greatest. It supports importing html files but somehow could not handle inline html in the editor very well. Right now I am syncing this particular section to a github repository that I could edit locally with obsidian. As I spent much time on this already, I would probably migrate the rest to github and enrich the contents a bit more in the upcoming days, with a fair deadline of before Feburary :)

Another thing that haunted me was that if I set up a heading at the beginning of the .md file, it would use the heading instead of the document title here. Git sync is also acting up because of this it's bugging my mind a little bit...

Bunch of complains but before I move on to have customized codes for pushing .md files on my website I think I would stay here with Gitbook

#### everything after that

Got frustrated with Gitbook because of this and spent some hours exploring daucusaurus, was initially excited by the flexibility but then gradually realize that the flexibility comes with a huge cost of having to go through individual compnents in their node modules so as to achieve freedom.

Ranted a lot about it then erik suggested astro, so here we are.
