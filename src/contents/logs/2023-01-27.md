## what have I done today

### work stuff

Oooo interesting day that I had.

Started off with applying for a data analyst job from a company focusing on reducing the energy consumption of the industry in general. I was examining myself as a person while writing the cover letter and somehow got very emotional thinking about what happened in the past years.

Sorted out the github credential managern issue meanwhile.

Then I started to work on the todo list I set for myself yesterday and it's, yes, tiny bit bumpy.

Was trying to set the static path for the documentation pages without reading the documentation, spent hours trying to figure out why I could get the static path but the static path was not giving.

When the day was still not dark yet, I finally decided to read through the routing documentation page properly and figured out that the magic word for routing is not simply just 'slug' or the brackets, it to actually use that piece of text within the brackets in the params.

**Daily reminders for me to stop believing that if you stare at codes for long enough then you will figure everything out.**

So eventually I only had time to figure out the routing system but glad that I have a better understanding of this framework now. The docs overview page is fully functioning, listing the documentations that I want to expand graudally.

Was just looking at setting up the documentation page itself properly with different .md files rendering on the same page. Then realised that routing system is completely different and I should keep on with it tomorrow instead.

### other Stuff

Didn't do much on the side today, in Utrecht right now with erik. Was a bit disappointed by Rosalia's new song :()

## what I would want to do tomorrow

Now the website is looking steady, I can finally come up with a todo list with priorities.

high:

- Figure out how to embed sidebars listing different md files and sections within the mds in the documentations
- figure out how including images work in the md files in this template

low (for details see [yesterday's post](https://docs.aquapichu.com/posts/26-01-2023))

- automatic date and time logging
- fix css/tailwind style system

## final rants

is even colder out there but it is nice and warm inside, i think i'd like to do a bit of gaming before sleeping, goodbye world x
