## what have i done today

### work stuff

oh boy where shall we start

Atro was truly a pleasant experience from the start, the cute animated block character talking to you when you are just starting one of the example project, their beautiful beautiful documentation page and tons of pretty template (like [this one I am using right now](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper)) just to kick things off.

It got me.

This template also got me with the sleek look and cute little tildas in the header.

Then it was time for rabbit hole.

To personalise the template I removed the tags page and combined it with the post page itself, removed the tags related main scripts without a second thought then a few hours later I found myself clicking on the tags into the 404.

It sounds way dumber when I typed this out.

Yes I should never have done this do not be like me.

Before running into this reality check I was perplexed by the routing mechanism, until a point that I thought 'slug' was the magic word to set up the routings.

And yes this is also the consequence you get from directly jumping into a template without going through the official documentation, please learn from my mistake.

I am talking to my future self.

Meanwhile me still not understanding fully how routing works in astro, is going to put this task into the next session in this post.

My idea is to have a cute text version of my personal website, mainly just logging and write documentations for the stuff I am working on right now. So I would like to add the documentation components as well. Unfortunately due to my dumbness I only had time to add the landing page and place holders based on the [Astro Design System & Docs](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-design-system/) template. But in order to get it work I do need to have a better understanding of the routing.

Also the last bit that I really spent a lot of time trying to figure out today (which is not as dumb) was the tailwind customization of this template. It was very very confusing and I think I would like to adjust it fully in the future (also to dump into the next section).

### Other stuff

- Went to physio, the therapist cracked my neck and backbone and felt great afterwards.
- Attempted second run elden ring without erik, death by two different dragons, dogs in caelid, some random spirit of the magic people somewhere beyond caelid. But managed to get at least an extra map.
- Went with kirk to get his climbing shoes but oh boy, it is dead hard to find good stuff in the physical stores around central amsterdam.

## what I would want to do tomorrow

- First of all very very very important please at least go through: [astro routing documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/routing/)
- if you have the patience and energy please also go through: [Tutorial:buidling a blog with astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/)
- After that embed the documentation template into the place holders in docs
- this might be a long term project but organize the style on this website, choose inline tailwind css only or get on with the customization:
  - (something puzzling but not affecting the functionality) find out how are the .prose styles from the base.css used
  - if you made sense of the whole thing maybe try to embed the obsidian style you are using right now, at least for the links and highlighting
- also a less important thing: the date and time in the frontmatter seems to be self updating but there was some type errors with jsx file (obsviously because it is jsx), would be nice to resolve it !!!
- github seems not be remembering my personal access token so I have to enter the token every time that I push, tried the cache command but it wasn't working, need to figure out a solution for this.

## Final rants

zzzzzzzz, is still cold out there, good night world x
